# YASH_PROJECT_ETHNOTECH

 Light/Dark Mode Toggle
-This project allows users to switch between light and dark themes on a webpage using a simple toggle switch. The user's theme preference is saved in the browser using localStorage, ensuring the selected theme persists across page reloads.

1) Key Features:
-Toggle Switch: A visually interactive switch lets users toggle between light and dark modes.
-Smooth Transitions: CSS transitions are applied for a smooth switch between themes.
-Persistent Theme: The chosen theme is saved using localStorage, ensuring it is remembered even after the page is refreshed.
-Responsive Design: The layout is simple and clean, ensuring usability on both desktop and mobile devices.

2) How It Works:
-When the user interacts with the toggle switch, the webpage background and text color change accordingly.
-The current theme is reflected in a status text ("ON" for dark mode, "OFF" for light mode).
-Upon reloading, the theme is automatically set based on the last user preference stored in localStorage.

3) Technologies Used:
-HTML: Structure of the page and toggle switch.
-CSS: Styling and smooth transitions for the theme switch.
-JavaScript: Handles the toggle functionality and stores the user preference in localStorage.
-This summary will help viewers understand the purpose and functionality of your project quickly and clearly.
